### Jenkins Pipeline

#### Script Purpose:

- Expanded usage of "checkout" step and referencing the attributes of the 'scm' object from this step

- Basic info on commit (7-digit SHA-1) and changeset of the HEAD [git log ... | tail .. assumes that just one file is part of changeset which is not true always!!!]
